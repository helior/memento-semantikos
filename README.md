## Memento Semantikos
"Remember Semantics"


Dear Future Helior,
This repo is a personal reference guide to remind yourself of how to do a thing in the various languages you have used in the past. I know you often oscillate between computer languages and seldom remember how to do the most basic things. It's cool man, don't worry about it. I realize I can't rely on my memory (or Stack Overflow, frankly) but you can always rely on me to guide you.

Yours Always,
Past Helior
